# ðŸŽ® Video Game Industry Dashboard

This Tableau project presents an interactive, multi-dimensional dashboard that explores the evolution of the video game industry from 1995 to 2020.

It consists of three complementary sub-dashboards:

### 1. **Business Dashboard**
Focuses on Top 10 game publishers between 2000â€“2010, their best-selling titles, and regional market reliance (especially North America). It helps identify dominant players and strategic shifts in publishing.

### 2. **PC Gaming Enterprise Dashboard**
Analyzes PC sales and Steam platform ownership using 5-year time intervals. Highlights include:
- Discrepancies between ownership and sales
- Genre activity rate
- Publisher output per genre over time

### 3. **Demographic Dashboard**
Explores how game preferences vary by **age**, **region**, and **gender**, identifying:
- The 31â€“45 age group as the most engaged demographic
- Balanced gender interest in simulation/strategy games
- Regional preference trends

## ðŸ§  Insights

- North American market is critical to publisher success.
- Steam ownership does not always equate to revenue (free-to-play effects).
- Simulation & strategy genres attract older and more diverse player groups.

## ðŸ§© Challenges Addressed

- **Platform duplication** (same title across consoles)
- **Steam outliers** skewing visual clarity
- **Demographic group sparsity** (gender, age normalization)

By combining market, platform, and player data, this project offers rich strategic insight to developers, publishers, and analysts alike.
