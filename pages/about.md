# **About Me**

Hi! I’m Pete Chen, a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (MIM ‘26).  
I specialize in data analytics, visualization, and machine learning.  
My background blends technical skills with business insight — I enjoy using data to tell clear, actionable stories.
